  "Try the demo": look around TickList without making an account.
  - The guest gets their own private account (Firebase anonymous sign-in, lib/auth.ts), so the
    security rules protect a demo exactly like a real account.
  - The first time a guest has nothing yet, it's filled with examples (seedDemo in lib/actions.ts).
    A note on the device remembers that, so deleting the examples doesn't bring them back.
  - "End the demo" deletes everything the guest saved, then the guest account itself.
